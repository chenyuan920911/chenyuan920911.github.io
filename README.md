# Cooking The Data

I found that dealing with data science problems is very similar to cooking. You need to follow some steps, recipes but meanwhile
you gotta have the **passion**, **inspiration** for it. There are real techniques in data science and cooking, once you master it,
you combine, reorder or even develop your own methods.

Well, except for data science, I enjoy cooking and I imagine I cound turn my data science passion into wealth so that I can invest them
in my chef life, serious, I mean, going to culinary schools and opening my own restaurants. Well, that might be too far in the future, so,
I opened this "blog"??? to write down some of the projects, from small to big ones. I recently just realized that I was too focused on the
theoretical side and was ignoring the implementation. Just want to try out some samll projects, real techniques need practice anyway.
